            using a Billboard Charts dataset and Spotifyâ€™s API. We found that
            songs from the 1990s-2010s have a higher speechiness and a lower
            instrumentalness than popular songs from 1960s-1990s, suggesting a
            shift in music features over time, possibly due to this rise of new
            genres in the 90s such as rap music."
