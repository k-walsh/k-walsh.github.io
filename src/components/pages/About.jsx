            Here's a little bit about me: My name is Kiera Walsh! I am a junior
            at Brown University studying computer science and behavioral
            decision sciences.

          I am interested in the intersection between psychology and computer
          science, specifically in regards to user experience, and I am
          passionate about presenting data with user experience in mind. I love
          thinking about how users can get the most out of an interface and
          projects that combine important data with frontend development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my work, I love working with other people as a Teaching
          Assistance and volunteering at local elementary schools to introduce
          computer science to young children. You can also find me enjoying the
          outdoors or spending hours inside with a needle and thread.
        </p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy my portfolio!</p>
